\title{Check for overlapping molecules.}

\description{
	Check for molecules overlapping in m/z, 
	based on isotope fine structures from \code{\link[enviPat]{isopattern}}
	or on centroids/intensoids from \code{\link[enviPat]{envelope}}.
}

\usage{check_several(pattern, dmz, ppm = TRUE)}

\arguments{

  \item{pattern}{Output from \code{\link[enviPat]{isopattern}} or from \code{\link[enviPat]{envelope}}.}

  \item{dmz}{m/z window. In combination with \code{ppm=TRUE} set as ppm or with \code{ppm=FALSE} set as absolute m/z.}

  \item{ppm}{Should m/z window be set in ppm (\code{TRUE}) or absolute m/z (\code{FALsE})?}

}

\details{
Overlaps in m/z among molecules are screened for within the m/z tolerance defined by the arguments \code{dmz} and \code{ppm}. 
}

\value{
Dataframe with 4 columns, with number of rows equal to the length of argument \code{pattern}

	\item{compound}{Chemical formula of the compound}
	\item{warning}{Overlap detected?}
	\item{to?}{If overlap: with wich other compound(s)? Refers to row number, recycled for peak\#.}
	\item{peak\#}{If overlap: with which peak(s) of the other compound(s)? Refers to peak number.}
